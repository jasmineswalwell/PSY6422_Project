# PSY6422_Project
## Comparing Alcohol Specific Death Rates Across Deprivation Quintile and Gender

This is the final project for the module PSY6422. This visualisation aims to explore the relationship between alcohol specific mortality rates and deprivation. Socioeconomic deprivation has is an important factor in alcohol related deaths, with individuals living in more deprived areas experiencing disproportionately higher mortality rates than those in more affluent areas. This project aims to develop a visualisation which examines trends from 2011 to 2020, highlighting differences in alcohol-specific mortality between the most and least deprived groups for both males and females.
